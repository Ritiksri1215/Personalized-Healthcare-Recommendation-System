# Personalized (Healthcare) Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Personalized Healthcare Recommendation System** is a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence–based project designed to provide **tailored healthcare recommendations** to users based on their medical data, preferences, and interaction history. The system aims to support better healthcare decision-making by combining predictive analytics and intelligent recommendation techniques.

This system can be extended to multiple domains such as healthcare, e-commerce, education, and entertainment, with a primary focus on **health-related recommendations**.
